A domain interpretation of the simply typed lambda calculus, using the notion of categories with families. Type checked with Agda 2.6.1.

This version introduces a consistency relation, allowing one to model types such as the natural numbers and boolean values.

This is a work in progress, though almost complete. Currently, what remains to be done is the morphisms lam and ap, and related axioms.
